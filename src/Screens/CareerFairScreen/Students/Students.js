                    Environmental, Materials, Mechanical, Mining and Petroleum engineering, as well as several
                    sub-streams of engineering.

                    New to this year, by RSVPing on Eventbrite you will be provided with a coloured PRINTED
                    name tag to wear at the Career Fair. This will help employers identify your discipline and make
                    you stand-out from the crowd!
